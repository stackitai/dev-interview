# Dev Interview

This repo contains a bare bones hardhat project with the default example contract and tests. It is meant to be used as a starting point for a dev interview. To get started you should fork this repo and then clone it to your local machine.

When you are finished with the assignment you should push your changes to your fork and then send us the link to your repo. Make sure to include tests for your code.
